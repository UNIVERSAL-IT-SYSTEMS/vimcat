h1. vimcat

A supercat with Vim powers!

h2. How does it work?

Uses a headless Vim with the @:TOhtml@ command from the @2html.vim@ plugin, to create an HTML colorized output.

Then uses @elinks@ to dump the colorized output to the console.

h2. Options

This program has many options, but you would normally use a few.
A few options permits you to write arbitrary Vim commands.

Once you've found the right colors options to fit your needs (get the exact colors you have in Vim), you would create an alias.

h2. Performance

@:TOhtml@ does not offer good performance as it iterates over each and every character of the file,
finds any change in coloring, and produces the corresponding HTML tags if any change is detected.

@elinks@ fills the lines to full with with space characters.
In an attempt to reduce the load of the terminal, those trailing spaces are stripped by @sed@.

h2. TODO

* Debian packaging, with @--noplugin@ and embedded @2html.vim@ script

If performance requires:
* Rewrite a native vim syntax file handler,
* that outputs terminal color codes directly.
