h1. vimcat

A supercat with Vim powers!

h2. How does it work?

Uses a headless Vim and runs a convertion to translate the syntax highlighting into ANSI color codes, and print the file to the console to get colorized output.

The translation program is a Vim Script inspired by the @2html@ plugin (see @:help :TOhtml@).

h2. Options

This program has many options, but you would normally use a few.
A few options permits you to write arbitrary Vim commands.

h2. Performance

Inspecting the syntax highlighting with @synID()@ does not offer very good performance. Moreover the script needs to iterates over each and every character of the file, to finds any change in coloring, and produces the corresponding color codes if any change is detected.

h2. TODO

* Debian packaging

If performance requires:
* Rewrite a native vim syntax file handler.
